              imagining and implementing compassionate visions for collective
              transformation. Currently serving as the Senior Associate, Climate

              climate action grounded in justiceâ€”leveraging business as a force
              for good through a unique blend of systems thinking, environmental
              science, and creative strategy to foster climate solutions rooted
              in care and accountability. With a Master's in Climate Change, a
              Bachelor's in Environmental Geoscience, and a Certificate in Youth

              They've partnered with Indigenous-led organizations across
              Ontario, engaging deeply in projects rooted in decolonization,
              land-based learning, and health and wellness. Outside their role
              at B Lab, Clementina independently facilitates workshops focused
              on sustainable self-care and burnout prevention for non-profit
              staff. They've also co-led a weekend wellness retreat that wove
              together storytelling, somatic practice, and self-nourishment,
              that support community resilience.

              Clementina believes in joy as radical resistance, and in honoring
              the grief, absurdity, and sacredness of this life. They are most
              embodied when visiting Uruguay, drinking mate at the beach, or
              cooking over a fire with loved ones.
